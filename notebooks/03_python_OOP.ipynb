    "# 1. Classes and Objects:\n",
    "# A class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class. \n",
    "# You can define attributes (data) and methods (functions) within a class.\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age): # Constructor method to initialize the object\n",

    "# Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). \n",

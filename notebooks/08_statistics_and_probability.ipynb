    "## Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "- If you take many large, random samples from any population, the averages (means) of those samples will form a bell-shaped (normal) distribution, even if the original population's data isn't normally distributed (e.g., skewed)\n",
    "- The sampling distribution of the sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger\n",
    "- Independent of distribution of the population\n",
